## Motivation {auto-animate="true"}

In the core facility proteomics we perform protein identification, quantification and characterization of proteins, peptides, and post-translational modifications (PTMs).

-   sample origin

    -   cell lysates
    -   supernatant
    -   extracellular vesicles
    -   IP...

-   approach

    -   label-free with DIA for standard samples

    -   TMT-labeling for phosphoproteomics and other modifications

## Step4 - Missing values {auto-animate="true"}

There are two types of NAs:

**systematic NAs**: missing completely in some subgroups but detected in others (for at least half of the samples). These represent potential switch-like responses.

**random NAs**. They are missing in some samples, but the "missingness" is unrelated to subgroup. These samples do not require require imputation for statistical analysis to return pvalues.

\

::: fragment
In this dataset:

-   **422** proteingroups have **systematic NAs**

-   **2024** proteingroups have **random NAs**

## Questions

-   what is needed in order to allow for statistical test? (replication)
-   what are different ways to quantify proteins analyzed by mass spectrometry? (spectral counts, area of peak elution)
-   what are two types of missing values (systematic and random)
